- Facility (hospital), department, physician names
- Normalization of terms (q 4 hours => q4h)
- Better dupe recognition:
  * fracture 	bicondylar tibial plateau 		
  * fracture 	bicondylar tibial plateau 	right

- Logging of processing
- Multi-threading for optimization
- MachineLearning for extraction
- Ordering (priority) of tree processing 
- Scoring of tree processing 
- Better non-tagged processing

- Queued/Distributed processing

- ICD-10 database (standardized names for procedures)
- Spacy.io or Stanford NLP based 
- Better categorizations of phrases
- Database/UI driven â€“ configuration ( tagging patterns/terms & decisions )
- Optimizations for performance

- More detailed (procedure/measurement/) info results
- Drug use categorization
- More sample data (with different formats?)

- Medication 2 part names:
  * CLEANSER
